Because most of the assigned articles for the semester would relentlessly attack Null Hypothesis Significance Testing (NHST), I wanted students to first appreciate that, applied to the right sort of problem, NHST was a powerful tool to *challenge* our theories (not confirm them!).\n\nI thought this exercise would be most effective if students collected and analyzed their own data, which is easy to do these days as their smartphones are packed with sensors.\n\n![Tricorder](../../images/tricorder.jpg)\n\nI needed (1) a substantive theory that would do a pretty good job predicting  data from one of the smartphone sensors, but (2) nevertheless be falsifiable by those same data. I decided that students would collect data from their phone accelerometer while the phone was swinging like a pendulum from its charging cord. The acceleration would be pretty well modeled as a damped simple harmonic oscillator, but we should also be able to detect deviations from the predictions of the model, thus pointing to new physics!\n\nThese students are in the social sciences, so I worried a bit if some of the mathematical machinery would be common knowledge, e.g.,trig functions and simple derivatives and differential equations. More importantly, would *I* remember this stuff from freshman physics over 30 years ago?\n\nTo collect data straight off their smartphone sensors, I had students install the free SparkVue app (available for [iPhone](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/sparkvue/id361907181?mt=8#) and [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.isbx.pasco.Spark&hl=en)).\n\nI then had them hang their phone from its charging cable, start the app recording data with a sampling rate of at least 40 Hz, and then let the phone swing freely for about 30-60 seconds (over something soft, in case the phone fell). Here are the data I got from my wife's iphone:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n| Time (s)| Acceleration - x (m/s²)| Acceleration - y (m/s²)| Acceleration - z (m/s²)| Acceleration - resultant (m/s²)|\n|--------:|-----------------------:|-----------------------:|-----------------------:|-------------------------------:|\n|    0.000|                    11.0|                     5.2|                     5.7|                            13.4|\n|    0.025|                    10.8|                     5.2|                     6.5|                            13.6|\n|    0.050|                    10.8|                     5.2|                     6.5|                            13.6|\n|    0.075|                    10.8|                     5.2|                     6.5|                            13.6|\n|    0.100|                    10.9|                     5.2|                     6.2|                            13.5|\n|    0.125|                    10.9|                     5.2|                     6.2|                            13.5|\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe y-axis is the long axis of the phone, so that's the vector we want. Here's what the data look like:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nhttp://thevirtuosi.blogspot.com/2011/08/fun-with-iphone-accelerometer.html\n\n2. Hang your device from a string (or maybe its charging cable) attached to something so that your device can swing freely like a pendulum.\n\nThe string should be about 18 inches long.\n\nThe device should hang vertically.\n\nI did this simply by hanging an iPhone upside down from it’s charging cable.\n\nDo not hold the string or cable in your hand. Attach it to something fixed.\n\nMeasure the distance from the middle of your device to the point where the string or cable is attached (should be around 18 inches). Write down this number somewhere.\n\nDo this over a rug or something soft to protect your device in case it accidentally falls.\n\n3. Follow the instructions in the attached PDF to collect data from the on-board accelerometer. You want “Acceleration Y” (the Y-axis is the long axis of your device).\n\nBefore you hit the green “Play” button, follow the instructions to increase the “Periodic” sampling rate from 10 Hz to at least 40 Hz or greater.\n\nClick the green Play button, and then set your device gently swinging for about 60 seconds. Don’t touch it while it’s swinging.\n\nClick the stop button.\n\nYou should see a graph of the acceleration data.\n\nClick the “Share” icon at the top, shaped kinda like this: <: , then click the “Export Data” button, and then email yourself the data. You should receive an email with the ExportedData.csv file.",
