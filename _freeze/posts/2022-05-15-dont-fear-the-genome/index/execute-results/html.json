First, what we don't understand about the human genome vastly exceeds what we do understand. Second, that the most popular conception of the genome, which I will refer to as the DIFF model, though widely accepted by biologists and social scientists of all stripes, is ridiculously misleading. Third, research is exploding on an immeasurably better model that I'll term REG. Fourth, the DIFF model should be retired as the basis of genetics education and replaced with the REG model.\n\n## The proteome\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Protein classes.
